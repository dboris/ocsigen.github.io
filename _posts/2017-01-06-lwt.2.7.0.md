[Lwt 2.7.0][changelog] was released today. This release aims to (1) improve communication between maintainers and users, and (2) prepare for (minor) [breaking changes][notice] to some APIs in Lwt 3.0.0 (planned for April).

To this end:

- Lwt now uses deprecation warnings (`[@deprecated]`), especially for upcoming breaking changes. This required dropping support for OCaml 4.01.
- There is a gradual, communicative, conservative [process][breaking] for deprecation and breaking. Maintainers of packages in OPAM get [notified proactively][notice]. If you have code not published in OPAM, watch the Lwt repo, recompile the code at least once in three months, or subscribe to the Lwt [announcements issue][announcements].
- If a planned breaking change is a bad idea, please let the maintainers know when you see the warning.
- Lwt now uses [semantic versioning][semver]. The major version will grow slowly but steadily, but this does not mean that the whole API is being redesigned or broken.

If you are releasing a package to OPAM that depends on Lwt, it is not
recommended to constrain Lwt to its current major version. A major
release of Lwt will break only a few APIs, and your package is likely
not to be affected â€“ if it is, you will be notified. You may, however,
wish to constrain Lwt to a major version in your private or production
code.

### Additional changes

- The main OPAM package `lwt` is getting rid of some optional dependencies in 3.0.0, which are now installable through separate OPAM packages `lwt_ssl`, `lwt_glib`, `lwt_react`. This is to reduce recompilation of Lwt when installing OPAM packages `ssl`, `lablgtk`, and `react`.
- Values of types `'a Lwt.t` are now called *promises* rather than *threads*. This should eliminate a lot of confusion for beginners.

Lwt 2.7.0 also has a number of more ordinary changes, such as bug fixes
and the addition of bindings to `writev` and `readv`. See the [full
changelog][changelog].

### Future work

I am working on an all-new manual, including fully rewritten API documentation with examples. It should be ready towards the end of winter.

My hope is that all the above allows Lwt to be taken progressively into the future, at the same time making development more open and more humane.
