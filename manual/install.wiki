<<header |=Installing Ocsigen>>

To install Ocsigen, just download the packages you want using
[[https://opam.ocaml.org/|opam]],
the OCaml package manager.

If you plan to build a Web and/or mobile app with Ocsigen,
[[wiki("ocsigen-start"):|Ocsigen-start]] is a good place to start:
{{{
$ opam install ocsigen-start
}}}

If you want to start with a website with few client-side features,
you will probably need only [[wiki("eliom"):|Eliom]] to begin with:
{{{
$ opam install eliom
}}}

Please read the [[wiki("tuto"):latest/manual/basics|one page documentation]] first,
if you plan to write a client-server Web (or/and mobile) app,\\
or the [[wiki("tuto"):latest/manual/basics-server|Server-side programming documentation]],
if you want to learn traditional Web site programming in OCaml.\\
Several tutorials are available [[wiki("tuto"):|here]].
